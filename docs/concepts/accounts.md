# Accounts

## What is an Account?

An Account is a representation of a person, company, or other entity's registration and use of the serivces or interfaces of an Integration. 

For example, you may have separate email accounts for personal vs work both registered with the Gmail Integration.

## Why do we need Accounts?

Accounts help divide the data we work with into silos to ensure we have the desired authorization, security, attribution, and focus. In SKL, everything you do with an Integration happens using a specific Account.
