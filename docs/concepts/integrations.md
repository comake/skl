# Integrations

## What is an Integration?

An Integration is a software tool which has data and capabilities accessible via an API that can be communicated with to query for, mutate, receive messages about, or otherwise access or perform actions over data.

For example:

- [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) - A file storage tool which has a REST API exposing capabilities to upload, delete, edit sharing permissions, and manage versions of files and folders.
- [MedFusion](https://www.medfusion.com/) - A healthcare IT company which has REST APIs built according to the [FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) standards [exposing patients' medical data from John Hopkins Medicine](https://www.medfusion.com/lp/john-hopkins-medicine-patient-data-api/).
- [Go Ethereum](https://geth.ethereum.org/) - An open-source execution client for [the Ethereum Protocol](https://ethereum.org/en/) which has a JSON-RPC API exposing capabilities to get information about blocks, send transactions, and much more.

## What is the purpose of Integrations?

Using SKL, you choose what Integrations you want to interact with. Their APIs can be used to obtain data, be notified about events or messages, or perform operations to create, edit, delete or manipulate something, be it data or the real world!
