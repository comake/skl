### What about the Data Transfer Project?

- In SKL schemas and mappings are variable - can be edited and extended by users for their needs - whereas in DTP they are set.
- DTP is constructed using code. Can't build with it in any language
- data stays in control of apps - although it's easier to port between apps, DTP is not built to have the user move their data to a personal data store
- not linked data :(
- specifies how to bulk import and export, not perform single capabilities at a time
